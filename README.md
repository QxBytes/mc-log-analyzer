# mc-log-analyzer
This is a project that analyzes all of your minecraft logs. It searches for specific terms and can ignore terms that are irrelevant.
Certain features include presets, little-to-no configuration needed (for most users), creation of a text file with all your data,
creation of a spreadsheet with all your data, and total time in-game.

This project was made for minecraft log files (zipped log.gz) but can be extended to other fields as well based on different file types
and different means of reading files. 10 Years of Minecraft!
Created by QxBytes (2019).

IMPORTANT DEPENDENCY:
IF you change the code, you WILL need to add the JXL library (2_6_12) to your workspace (or add it in proguard as a library).
